# Baseplate.go Coding Style Guide

## Use tools

Make sure your code passes the following tools:

- `go vet`
- `gofmt -s`
- `staticcheck` (via `go install honnef.co/go/tools/cmd/staticcheck@latest`)

See our [IDE/Editor setup doc](Editor.md) for ways to doing that automatically.

### Exceptions

Generated code (e.g. code generated by thrift compiler) are exempted from this
rule.

## Import groups

Group your imports into the following 3 groups, in that order,
separated by blank lines:

1. Standard library packages
2. Third-party packages
   (non-stdlib packages without `github.com/reddit/baseplate.go` prefix)
3. Packages from the same module
   (packages with `github.com/reddit/baseplate.go` prefix)

Example:

```go
import (
	"time"

	"github.com/apache/thrift/lib/go/thrift"

	"github.com/reddit/baseplate.go/log"
)
```

## Rename imports

When an imported package name is different from what is implied by the
final element(s) of the import path, rename the import it to make it explicit.

Example:

```go
import (
	jwt "gopkg.in/dgrijalva/jwt-go.v3"
	opentracing "github.com/opentracing/opentracing-go"
)
```

### Exceptions

The implied package name of all of the following is still "foo", and thus
they do not need to be renamed:

* `.../foo.v1`
* `.../foo/v1`
* `.../foo-go`
* `.../foo.go`

Most import tools already understand these conventions.

## One-per-line style

When putting all args to a function signature/call to a single line makes the
line too long, Use one-per-line style with closing parenthesis on the next line.
Please note that in function signatures one-per-line means one group per line
instead of one arg per line.

Example:

```go
func foo (
	arg1, arg2 int,
	arg3 string,
	arg4 func(),
) error {
	// Function body
	return nil
}

foo(
	1,
	2,
	"string",
	func() {
		// Function body
	},
)
```

When writing slice/map literals in one-per-line style,
also make sure to put the closing curly bracket on the next line.

Example:

```go
slice := []int{
	1,
	2,
	3,
}

myMap := map[int]string{
	1: "one",
	2: "two",
}
```

### Exceptions

When using slice literal/args as key-value map,
use two-per-line style to make sure that we always have them in pair.

Example:

```go
log.Errorw(
	"Something went wrong!",
	"err", err,
	"endpoint", "myEndpoint",
)
```

## Blank line to highlight change of logical level

Sometimes two consecutive lines could be on the same indentation level but not
the same logical level.
This usually happens when a long `if` condition is broke into multiple lines.
In such cases,
please add a blank line between them to highlight the change of logical level.

Example:

```go
if condition1 && condition2 &&
	condition3 && condition4 {

	// do something, note the blank line before this line.
	foo()
}
```
